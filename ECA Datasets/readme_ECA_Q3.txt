- Note that we assume "source node" as node_ID=1

- first column: node_ID

- second column: initial shortest path distance from source node. 
		 Note: we assume the value of "10000" as 
                       an arbitary large distance.

- third column: describe a list of neighbors with their respective
		distance to the node. For example, "n_1,d_1:n_2,d_2:" means
		that a given node has 2 neighbors: (i) neighbor node "n_1" 
                with inter-nodal distance "d_1", (ii) neigbhor node "n_2"
		with inter-nodal distance "d_2".
