## Question 3
In your local machine’s Spark setup, develop a PySpark program using PySpark RDD APIs to perform the following tasks. 

Show your full PySpark program and provide screenshots and results for all key steps where applicable.

Data sources used in this question are: (i) 5-node-graph.txt, (ii) 20-node-graph.txt, (iii) 40-node-graph.txt.

Note that these data files can be downloaded from ICT337 Canvas webpage.

Based on PySpark framework, we like to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) so as to compute shortest path from a given source node to every other destination nodes in a weighted graph.
